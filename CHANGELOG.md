    - Automatically checks integrity first and only rebuilds if needed
    - `--force` flag to skip checks and rebuild unconditionally
    - Shows which databases were rebuilt vs skipped

  - Tests multiple query patterns (simple MATCH, phrase queries, multi-word phrases)
  - Retrieves actual content from blocks table to detect missing rows
  - Critical for external content tables where FTS index can reference deleted rows
